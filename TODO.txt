1. Order leadership roles by party
2. Senators.html should provide a way to filter the senators in step 2 above by: 

- Filter senators by party (with ‘show all’ as the default option). (Done)

- Filter senators by state (with ‘show all’ as the default option). 

- Filter senators by rank (with ‘show all’ as the default option).

3. Two Navbars into one Navbars
4. Duplication of leadership roles when we apply filters
5. Delete the filter navbar
